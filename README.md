# üóÇÔ∏è Private Document Chat

Build a chatbot powered by LlamaIndex that augments GPT 4 with the content of your private documents. This versatile application allows you to interact with any document in a conversational manner, making it easier to find information or learn from the document's contents.

- Utilizes Streamlit's `st.chat_input` for taking user queries and `st.chat_message` for displaying both user queries and model responses.
- Leverages LlamaIndex to load, index your private documents, and create a chat engine. This engine retrieves context from the indexed data to respond to each user query effectively.
